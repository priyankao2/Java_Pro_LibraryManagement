# Java_Pro_LibraryManagement

“I built a Library Management System using Java and MySQL. It allows managing books, members, and issuing/returning books while keeping the stock updated automatically. I implemented secure database operations and basic transaction handling. This project helped me strengthen my Java programming, database handling, and problem-solving skills, and gave me hands-on experience building a real-world backend application.”
